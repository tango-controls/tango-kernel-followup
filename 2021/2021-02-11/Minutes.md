## Gitlab migration

- cppTango/itango/pytango/TangoSourceDistribution migration is done
- RFC repo is prepared for migration
- Remaining planned migrations are under actions

## JTango migration

Bintray is being shutdown. cpptango uses it, but is planning to migrate away from it. JTango depends on bintray and that
is discontinued, gitlab supports maven repositories, see https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/maven_repository/ but
only for java 11, but java 8 is required as well.

## Tango RFCs

- Migration to gitlab is immanent
- scripts will be added for PDF generation, there will be a single PDF file
- readthedocs HTML is also requested, Benjamin Bertrand will supply some script to Piotr for MD-\>HTML conversion

## conda recipes

Work is ongoing to create a separate cppTango package which hold debug symbols. https://github.com/conda-forge/cpptango-feedstock/pull/2

## cppTango: branch organization
(Question from Thomas B.): Is it still desired that we actively manage two branches: 9.3-backports and tango-9-lts? The current approach
is that both are managed and 9.3-backports would also be the source of 9.3.5 which is just 9.3.4 with fixes.

- Many opinions, everyone is using 9.3.4, nobody is using 9.4.x from tango-9-lts
- Lorenzo likes 9.3.x because it can be compiled on legacy platforms like powerpc
- Reynald proposes that once 9.4.0 is released, 9.3-backports branch will not be activly developed anymore, we might
  still accept bugfix PRs
- 9.3-backports will keep using appveyor, tango-9-lts will be trying gitlab runners
- Vincent proposes to communicate how we support each version
- We (tango controls) communicated that we support 9.3 for 5 years, 9.3.0 came out in May 2018
- Sergey says that the LTS period should only start once V10 (which might not be able to speak to tango < 10)

Conclusion:
  - Rename tango-9-lts to main, rename master to tango-v10
  - Backport important bugfixes from main to 9.3-backports
  - Continue releasing 9.3.X versions with bugfixes from 9.3-backports
  - Once 9.4 is released from main, we reconsider how we can support 9.3-backports

### Next teleconf meeting

Tango Kernel Teleconf Meetings take place on the 2nd and 4th Thursday of each month, at 15:00 CET or CEST (Paris time).

So the next Tango Kernel Teleconf Meeting will take place on Thursday 25th February 2021 at 15:00 **CET**.
