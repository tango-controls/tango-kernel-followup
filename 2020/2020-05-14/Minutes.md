## cppTango News

cppTango 9.3.4-rc5 has been released.

Since last week, ESRF is using cppTango 9.4.0-rc0 (esrf-9.4.0-rc0 tag from cppTango bourtemb's fork) version in 
operation for the device servers controlling the White Rabbit timing devices because the new server_init_hook() feature 
was needed). No issue reported so far.

## JTango News

Events issues are being fixed. 
A new release will be out once the event issues will have been solved.

## PyTango News

PyTango 9.3.2 has been released.

Zibi detected an issue with PyTango 9.3.2 on Windows (Windows: DLL load fail with 9.3.2 64bit wheel 
([pytango#355](https://github.com/tango-controls/pytango/issues/355))).

Anton asked for some feedback from Andy Goetz and Sebastien Gara on this issue but got no reply so far.

**Action - ESRF**: Try to get some feedback from Sebastien Gara and Andy Goetz on [pytango#355](https://github.com/tango-controls/pytango/issues/355)

## Tango Source Distribution

TangoSourceDistribution 9.3.4-rc4 has been released and has been uploaded in Debian experimental by Frederic Picca.

TangoSourceDistribution 9.3.4-rc5 will be out when a new version of JTango will be available.

Anton asked when we can expect to get an official release (without the rc suffix).  
Reynald said that it is important that the JTango event fixes are present in the next official release.  
Thomas mentioned that he encountered some issues with the Java tools when he tried to test an upgrade. It is important to 
fix these kinds of issues before making an new official release.

## Conan packages

Marius Elvert from Software Schneiderei had to compile cppTango on recent Windows compilers for a project with KIT (ANKA).  
To avoid to do this tedious task manually several times, he spent some time to build conan recipes for cppTango and omniorb 
which are available at the following git repositories:

- https://github.com/softwareschneiderei/conan-cpptango
- https://github.com/softwareschneiderei/conan-omniorb

To use the Conan recipe, configure conan with the following command:

`conan remote add schneide https://api.bintray.com/conan/softwareschneiderei/conan`

and add the following requirement to your project:
`cpptango/9.3.3@softwareschneiderei/stable`

This is currently tested on Win10/VS2019 and some Debian Linux variants (9 and 10). 
Binary packages for some of the variants are also available.

Marius mentioned that he had to use some hacks (patches on the CMakeLists.txt files) to make it work quickly, while 
waiting for his PRs in cppTango to be merged.  
He proposed several PRs in cppTango to make it cleaner. The cppTango team thank him very much for this contribution.

Marius mentioned that he would be very interested in the possibility to work for the Tango-Controls community in a similar way 
as we currently do with S2Innovation and Byte Physics for instance (contract with the Tango-Controls collaboration).

## Conda packages

### tango-test conda package
TangoTest 3.0 has been released (first release using CMake).  
PR [tango-conda-recipes#2](https://github.com/tango-controls/tango-conda-recipes/pull/5) for tango-test conda package has been created and is to be reviewed.

### pytango conda package
Reynald started to work on building a new pytango conda package and got the following errors during the conda build process: 

```
ld: cannot find -lboost_python
```

More details can be found in [pytango-conda-recipes#1](https://github.com/tango-controls/pytango-conda-recipes/pull/1).

### Storage limitations on anaconda cloud

Tiago warned Reynald via e-mail that anaconda cloud has a limit of 3 GB for tango-controls conda channel packages.  
Current usage is ~458 MB (14% Full).  
This 3GB limit might be an issue in the future if many packages or versions of these packages are created.

## Tango meeting 2020

The Tango meeting will not take place in June in Russia. It is postponed to 17th to 19th November 2020, still in Saint Petersburg.

The TANGO steering committee has decided to do a TANGO status update in the form of a webinar on 10th June 2020.  
The draft agenda is available here: https://indico.esrf.fr/indico/event/48

## High priorities issues

- appveyor: Add support for automatic uploading of releases to github ([cppTango#602](https://github.com/tango-controls/cppTango/issues/602))
- Backport fix for #496 and #361 - event clients lost after dev restart ([cppTango#702](https://github.com/tango-controls/cppTango/issues/702))
- Safe interworking between read_attribute() and push_event() ([cppTango#698](https://github.com/tango-controls/cppTango/issues/698))
